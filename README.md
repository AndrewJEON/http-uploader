http-uploader
=============

Also known as VCU: Vasnake web Chunked Uploader.
You can upload files of any size over HTTP using resumable file upload service.

For some time past, since I had that idea, I had made several attempts to build VCU.
Two versions using Plone/Zope backend with Silverlight applet as a client.
For those versions, also console client was created, written in Python.
One version using HTML5 FileAPI, Socket.io and Node.js as a backend.
One version using PHP on backend and Flash applet as a client.

All that stuff  you can find here

* node.uploader -- VCU version based on HTML5 FileAPI + Node.js + Socket.io technology.
* plupload.fixed -- Plupload (PHP + Flash/Silverlight), fixed and tested.
