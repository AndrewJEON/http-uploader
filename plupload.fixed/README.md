http-uploader
=============

Also known as VCU: Vasnake web Chunked Uploader.
You can upload files of any size over HTTP using resumable file upload service.

In 2010 Plupload wasn't good enough for me, so I had to fix it. There it is:
Plupload (PHP + Flash/Silverlight), fixed and tested -- http://vasnake.blogspot.ru/2010/11/chunked-upload.html

* app -- web app folder
* httpd.conf.diff -- Apache HTTPd config example
* php.ini.diff -- PHP config example
