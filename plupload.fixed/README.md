http-uploader
=============

Also known as VCU: Vasnake web Chunked Uploader.
You can upload files of any size over HTTP using resumable file upload service.

In 2010 Plupload wasn't good enough for me, so I had to fix it. There it is:
Plupload (PHP + Flash/Silverlight), fixed and tested -- http://vasnake.blogspot.ru/2010/11/chunked-upload.html

With Plupload you can't upload file bigger than 500 MB in one piece.
If you had to, split that file to smaller chunks with any file splitting tool,
then upload a bunch of chunks.

* httpd.conf.diff -- Apache HTTPd config example
